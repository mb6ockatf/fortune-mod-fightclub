<Tyler Durden> Do you know what a duvet is? It's a blanket. Just a blanket. Now why do guys like you and me know what a duvet is? Is this essential to our survival, in the hunter-gatherer sense of the word? No. What are we then? We are consumers. We're the byproducts of a lifestyle obsession

<Tyler Durden> Man, I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering. Goddammit, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables—slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man: No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war; our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off

<Tyler Durden> We are all part of the same compost heap

<Tyler Durden> Is that what a real man is supposed to look like?

<Tyler Durden> Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat. It's not a goddamn seminar. Stop trying to control everything, and just let go! LET GO!

<Tyler Durden> Hey, you created me -- take some responsibility!

<Tyler Durden> And the eighth and final rule — if this is your first time at Fight Club, you have to fight

<Tyler Durden> God damn! We just had a near-life experience, fellas

<Tyler Durden> Time to stand up for what you believe in

<Tyler Durden> If you are reading this, then this warning is for you: Every word you read of this useless fine print is another second off your life. Don't you have other things to do? Is your life so empty that you honestly can't think of a better way to spend these moments? Or are you so impressed with authority that you give respect and credence to all that claim it? Do you read everything you're supposed to read? Do you think everything you're supposed to think? Buy what you're told to want? Get out of your apartment. Meet a member of the opposite sex. Stop the excessive shopping and masturbation. Quit your job. Start a fight. Prove you're alive. If you don't claim your humanity, you will become a statistic. You have been warned

<Tyler Durden> This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time
